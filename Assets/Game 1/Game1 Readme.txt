This is a mod of the Egg Catch Game, the first project of the Intro Projects that we went over in class.

Modifications:
Switched position-based movement to physics-based movement for both the Player and the "eggs."
Player controls are now:
W: increase thrust forwards.
A: small thrust left.
S: slow down to a stop.
D: small thrust right.
Q: turn the ship left.
R: turn the ship right.
Space: fire a laser.
The eggs were turned into space aliens, which instead of spawning from the top of the screen and falling down, spawn in a circle randomly about the screen and head off-center.
The player's objective is now to dodge and destroy the spawning objects rather than collect them. Use the game's turning and thrust mechanics to get out of the way of aliens and destroy them with the laser.
Get hit by enough aliens and your ship explodes and you lose the game.
The play field has been rebounded to accomodate the new movement, with invisible walls about the edges of the screen but not off-screen so that the player doesn't lose themselves.
Explosions have been attached to all objects when they die violently - the aliens explode in a green burst and let out a yelp while the ship explodes in a heap with an appropriate sound.
The lasers and the creature screams are chosen randomly from an array of different sounds to give the game some variance.
The score goes up as you kill the aliens, and each time you break your high score the game updates that value, even after you close it so you can keep track of your personal best.
Added music to make the game feel more thematic and dynamic.
You can press 'R' after death to restart the game or 'ESC' to return to the game menu and select one of the other games.
